# flexbox-landing-page

Project for the foundations flexbox section of the of The Odin Project

Post project reflection:
At this point, I think it looks close enough to call it completed. The prompt says it doesn't need to be pixel perfect.

Earlier, I was thinking about going back through the CSS and generalizing the redundant styles into a single class and tidying up the file, but I've decided to keep it as is so I can review it after getting further in the course.

There's two buttons on the page and I haven't gotten to the javascript part of the course, so they aren't expected to do anything. I've been working on other projects outside of TOP that use javascript, so it felt like a waste to just let them do nothing. I went ahead and put in a simple onclick alert.
